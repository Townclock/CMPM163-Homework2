This Project features two scenes:

One scene uses Perlin Noise to create rocky pillars of varying heights. This scene features a reflection system that reflects the skybox. A texture is used to distort the normals of the skybox creaating the effect of uneven water. The sky features a checkerboard that is likewise distorted by the normals of the same texture as it moves across it.

The other scene features a skater figure. Particle systems are used for both the skates and hair. The shader used on the model implements an outline effect, the bloom effect worked in lab (unmodified), and an xray effect.
